<h1>API</h1>
-----------

<p>API endpoints for the snippet backend<p>

<p>All endpoints, except those for account login and creation, require authentication</p>

<p>If authentication fails, a 401 status code is returned as well as an error message.</p>

<p>For valid authentication, the authentication token received on login or account creation must be passed as the
'auth_token' parameter. For example, /users/all?auth_token=-ibgefjRw6VSEj97VPgx</p>

<h2>**** Authorization ****</h2>

<h3>Create a new account </h3>

POST request to /users/new with the parameters 'email' and 'password'.</p>
*Does NOT require authentication<p>
On failure the error messages are returned.<p>
On success a user object is returned which contains the user_id, email, and authentication_token.</p>

<h3>Login to an existing account </h3>

<p>POST request to /users/sign_in with the parameters 'email' and 'password'</p>
<p>*Does NOT require authentication    </p>
<p>On failure an error message is returned.</p>
<p>On success the 'auth_token' and 'id' are returned. 'id' is the user_id of the signed in user, and 'auth_token' is the
authorization token that needs to be included with each api call. </p>

<h3>Password Reset </h3>

<p>/users/:user_id/reset_password</p>
<p>*Does NOT require authentication</p>
<p>Sends an email to the user that allows them to reset their password</p>

<h3>Logout</h3>

<p>POST request to /users/sign_out
<p>Must include the parameter 'email' of the account to be logged out</p>
<p>A successful call to logout deletes the authentication token so that no further requests can be made using it.</p>
