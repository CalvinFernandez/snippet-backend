What is a Lyricoo?

Lyricoos are “bites of songs” creating a new way of sending a musical message…
Lyricoos are a way of showing your creativity and playing with the meaning of music to express yourself when you don’t have the words
Lyricoos are a way of getting your point across, getting out of the doghouse, or letting someone know you’d like to get to know them better
Lyricoos are… whatever you want them to be – we hope you will play around with the app and come up with ways to use it that we haven’t even considered!

About the test

We are testing the idea of using “bites of lyrics” to communicate, share emotions and have fun. However, the app is in beta and is designed with minimal functionality for now – so please excuse any bugs! Should we decide to build it out, it will be more robust, user friendly and have more features.
This test will run from September 20 – October 2 - then the site will be taken down temporarily for further construction. Don't wait to download and use the app!
Please -- Try this out, share it with as many people as you would like – and let us know what you think!

To Invite Others…

Click on the '+' in the upper right hand corner of the message window and type an email in the input box.
Choose a Lyricoo that expresses the sentiment you wish to send by selecting it and clicking on the “send” icon
Compose any message you want and click send. The recipient will automatically be invited to join.
After you have invited someone, they will be added to your contacts so that you can continue to exchange Lyricoos with them (your conversation will stay in your message window)
Please feel free to share and invite AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU WOULD LIKE

Feedback

Over the course of the test, you may be asked to answer a question or provide some information – please take a moment to do this when asked – it is extremely helpful to our experiment!
We really appreciate your feedback and suggestions – please send any comments, questions, etcetera to Meredith@lyricoo.com
